h1. GLApp - A tiny wrapper for ruby-opengl

It's simple:

# require "glapp"
# Include GLApp
# Override as many of the callbacks as you need:

  * setup
  * update(seconds)
  * draw
  * keyboard_down(key, modifiers)
  * keyboard_up(key, modifiers)
  * special_keyboard_down(key, modifiers)
  * special_keyboard_up(key, modifiers)
  * mouse_click(button, state, x, y)
  * mouse_dragging_motion(x, y)
  * mouse_passive_motion(x, y)
# If you need more control, override the default behavior of these:

  * setup_context
  * pre_draw
  * post_draw
  * resize
# Call show with width, height, title, and whether to be full-screen

Look at the scripts in the examples/ directory.
In fact, here's one:

  require 'glapp'
  
  class MyGame
    include GLApp
    def draw
      glTranslate(0, 0, -5)
      glutSolidCube(2)
    end
  end
  
  MyGame.new.show 800, 600, "My Game"
