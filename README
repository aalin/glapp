A tiny wrapper for ruby-opengl
It's like LittleCoder, but for OpenGL
Write tiny applets without worrying about initialization crap

It's simple:

  1) require "gl_app"
  2) include GLApp
  3) override as many of the callbacks as you need:
     - setup
     - draw
     - update(seconds)
     - special_keyboard(key, modifiers)
     - mouse_click(button, state, x, y)
     - mouse_active_motion(x, y)
     - mouse_passive_motion(x, y)
     - keyboard(key, modifiers)

Look at the scripts in the examples/ directory.
In fact, here's one:

  require "gl_app"
  include GLApp

  def draw
    glTranslate 0, 0, -5
    glutSolidCube 2
  end

  go_windowed 800, 600
